# Table: googleworkspace_admin_reports_activity - Query Google Workspace Admin Reports Activity using SQL

The Reports API is a RESTful API you can use to access information about the Google Workspace activities of your users.

## Table Usage Guide

The `googleworkspace_admin_reports_activity` table in Steampipe provides a unified interface to query the Google Workspace Admin Reports API. It surfaces detailed audit logs across all Workspace applications (Drive, Calendar, Keep, Admin console, and more). You can use this table to investigate user actions, system events, and security-related activities within your Workspace environment.

**Important Notes**

- You must `application_name` in a `where` clause in order to use this table ([List of all applications](https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/reports/reference/rest/v1/activities/list?hl=fr#applicationname)).
- For improved performance, it is advised that you use the optional qual `time` to limit the result set to a specific time period.
- This table supports optional quals. Queries with optional quals are optimised to use Activity filters. Optional quals are supported for the following columns:
  - `actor_email`
  - `ip_address`
  - `event_name`

## Examples

### List all Drive events in the last hour

Retrieve audit events for Google Drive that occurred in the past hour.

```sql+postgres
select
  time,
  actor_email,
  event_names,
  param->>'value' as file_name,
  ip_address,
  events
from
  googleworkspace_admin_reports_activity as a 
  cross join lateral jsonb_array_elements(a.events) as evt 
  cross join lateral jsonb_array_elements(evt->'parameters') as param 
where
  application_name = 'drive' 
  and param->>'name' = 'doc_title' 
  and time > now() - interval '1 hour';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  time,
  actor_email,
  event_names,
  param->>'value' as file_name,
  ip_address,
  events
from
  googleworkspace_admin_reports_activity as a 
  cross join lateral jsonb_array_elements(a.events) as evt 
  cross join lateral jsonb_array_elements(evt->'parameters') as param 
where
  application_name = 'drive' 
  and param->>'name' = 'doc_title' 
  and time > datetime('now', '-1 hour');
```

### List all password changes performed by administrators on users

  events
from
  googleworkspace_admin_reports_activity as a
  cross join lateral jsonb_array_elements(a.events) as evt
  cross join lateral jsonb_array_elements(evt->'parameters') as param
where
  application_name = 'admin'
  and event_name = 'CHANGE_PASSWORD'
  and param->>'name' = 'USER_EMAIL'
  and time > now() - interval '1 month';
```

```sql+sqlite

where
  application_name = 'login'
  and actor_email = 'xxx@xxx.xxx'
  and event_name = 'login_failure'

```

```sql+sqlite
select
  time,
  event_names,
  ip_address
from
  googleworkspace_admin_reports_activity
where

```

### Show all connections from a new device

  googleworkspace_admin_reports_activity as a
  cross join lateral jsonb_array_elements(a.events) as evt
  cross join lateral jsonb_array_elements(evt->'parameters') as param1
  cross join lateral jsonb_array_elements(evt->'parameters') as param2
where
  application_name = 'mobile'
  and event_name = 'DEVICE_REGISTER_UNREGISTER_EVENT'
  and param1->>'name' = 'DEVICE_ID'
