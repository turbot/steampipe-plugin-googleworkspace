# Google Workspace + Steampipe

[Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com) is a collection of cloud computing, productivity and collaboration tools, software and products developed and marketed by Google.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

For example:

```sql
select
  summary,
  hangout_link,
  start_time,
  end_time
from
  googleworkspace_calendar_my_event
where
  start_time > now()::timestamp
  and end_time < ('now'::timestamp + interval '1 day');
```

```
+----------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| summary        | hangout_link                         | start_time          | end_time            |

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest Google Workspace plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install googleworkspace
```

### Credentials

| Item        | Description |
| :---------- | :-----------|
| Credentials | 1. To use **domain-wide delegation**, generate your [service account and credentials](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation#create_the_service_account_and_credentials) and [delegate domain-wide authority to your service account](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation#delegate_domain-wide_authority_to_your_service_account). Enter the following OAuth 2.0 scopes for the services that the service account can access:<br />`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly`,<br />`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly`,<br />`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.other.readonly`,<br />`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/directory.readonly`,<br />`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`,<br />`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`<br />2. To use **OAuth client**, configure your [credentials](#authenticate-using-oauth-client). |
| Radius      | Each connection represents a single Google Workspace account. |
| Resolution  | 1. Credentials from the JSON file specified by the `credential_file` parameter in your steampipe config.<br />2. Credentials from the JSON file specified by the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.<br />3. Credentials from the client secret file specified by the `client_secret_file` in your steampipe config. |

### Configuration

Installing the latest googleworkspace plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/googleworkspace.spc`) with a single connection named `googleworkspace`:

```hcl
connection "googleworkspace" {
  plugin = "googleworkspace"

  # You may connect to google workspace using more than one option
  # 1. To authenticate using domain-wide delegation, specify service account credential file, and the user email for impersonation
  # `credential_file` (optional) - The path to a JSON credential file that contains service account credentials.
  # If not specified in a connection, credentials will be loaded from the path specified in
  # the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
  # credential_file         = "/path/to/my/creds.json"

  # `impersonated_user_email` (required) - The email (string) of the user which should be impersonated. Needs permissions to access the Admin APIs.
  # `impersonated_user_email` must be set, since the service account needs to impersonate a user with Admin API permissions to access the workspace services.
  # impersonated_user_email = "username@domain.com"


  # 2. To authenticate OAuth 2.0 client, specify client secret file
  # client_secret_file      = "/path/to/my/client-secret.json"
}
```

## Advanced configuration options

### Authenticate using OAuth client

You can use client secret credential to protect the user's data by only granting tokens to authorized requestors. Use following steps to configure credentials:

- [Configure the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#configure_the_oauth_consent_screen)
- [Create a OAuth client ID credential](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#create_a_oauth_client_id_credential), and download the client secret JSON file.
- Add the client secret JSON file path in steampipe config using `client_secret_file`.
- To generate the `token`, run [generateClientToken.go](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-googleworkspace/blob/main/scripts/generateClientToken.go) script in `steampipe-plugin-googleworkspace` directory:

  ```sh
  go run scripts/generateClientToken.go
  ```

- Make sure you have installed **[Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)**, before running the above script.
  
  **_NOTE:_** The first time you run the sample, it prompts you to authorize access:
  1. Browse to the provided URL in your web browser.
  2. If you're not already signed in to your Google account, you're prompted to sign in. If you're signed in to multiple Google accounts, you are asked to select one account to use for authorization.
  3. Click the **Accept** button.
  4. Copy the code you're given, paste it into the command-line prompt, and press **Enter**.
- After successful execution, it will save the token file to `~/.steampipe` directory.

**_NOTE:_**
  You need to regenerate the `token`, in case any modification has been made on scopes.

### Credentials from Environment Variables

By default, the plugin uses the credential file path provided in the connection config. You can also specify static credentials using environment variables:

```sh
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/my/creds.json
```
